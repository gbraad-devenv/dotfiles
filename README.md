dotfiles

Do not use this directly, but take parts and learn from it. I share it because
I got frustrated about moving a tarball around (and being scared of loosing
it). Which eventually happened when my notebook got stolen... so, this is not
an ideal solution yet. It only contains the basic from a tarball, and still
needs all the customization for vim, emacs, etc.
